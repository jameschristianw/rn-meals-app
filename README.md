# React Native Meals App
This app is part of React Native [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/) by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/).
This part showcases [**React Navigation**](https://reactnavigation.org/) (Part 6) and State Management using **React Redux** (Part 7) in a React Native App. 
The course use [React Navigation v4](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/4.x/getting-started), but the code in this repo use [React Navigation v5](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/5.x/getting-started).
The conversion is solely done because of my curiosity. The correct (or at least, the way he do it) is shown in the latter part (Part 15).

Part 6 is finished (not yet pushed to the repo), but part 7 is in progress.
